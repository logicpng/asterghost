//---------------------------Strings--------------------------

//As you can see above, this file was written by umeici, but unfortunately the rest of the text up there got a bit garbled at some point. I'll leave it though.

//Anyway, string.dic has to do with the right-click SSP menu, specifically the captions for the menu options. This is VERY IMPORTANT if you're going to set up the Network Update for your ghost! Otherwise this is just an easy place to customize your ghost's menu to your tastes. 

//If you're going to set up Network Update, make sure to read the walkthrough (http://www.ashido.com/ukagaka/) for more details! I won't get into the whole thing here, but this page has a very important value you will need to change for Network Update to work!
//Note also here that lines do not end with \e here. This is because the ghost isn't speaking these lines, they're just being used in the right-click menu.


//---- Username -----------------------------------------------------------------------
//Don't touch this.

//---- Network Update URL ----------------------------------------------
//This is the URL where your ghost will look for updates. If you're setting up Network Updates YOU MUST change this to point at the right directory! Otherwise your ghost will not update properly! If you're not going to use the Network Update feature, just leave this section as it is or delete it, it should be fine.

//---- Top Menu Option Caption -----------------------------------------
